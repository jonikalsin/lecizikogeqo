On October 16, the popular streamer had an emotional outburst after speaking on the phone with her spouse live on the stream. The streamer and her husband could be seen sharing a disturbing conversation, during which he threatened to murder their dogs and take all the money the popular Twitch star had earned.</p><p>The video of the disputed stream cannot be accessed on Amouranth’s Twitch account, however, the footage of the streamer visibly discussing the harassment she has had and is still experiencing has been circulating on social media.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Amouranth has revealed that she has a husband, along with revealing his abuse</p><p>He has threatened to kill her dogs, take all their money, and forced her to stream.</p><p>(1/4) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9tdL0S3Udd</a></p>— GUARD Hunter (@HUN2R) <a href=#>October 16, 2022</a></figure><p>In one footage, the streamer confronts her husband about why he claimed he was going to murder their dogs.

On his YouTube channel, Hasanabi revealed that he had been awoken by fellow streamers to check out Amouranth’s stream when the incident took place. While the VOD is now deleted, there are several excerpts of the disturbing conversation now doing the rounds on the internet.</p><p>In one of the most disturbing clips, when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amouranth</a>confronted him, she admitted that he had coerced her into running a constant livestream. After hearing the remark, the husband exploded, saying:</p><p>“No! I did not say that! Now you’re just f***ing being a liar! I said, ‘I’m going to tell you what I said, in terms of the earlier!’ You’re saying you did not say that! And then you tell me, ‘What did you say?'”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To this HasanAbi reacted saying that he has never seen anything to this degree of domestic violence. He said, “This person is like so insane. The text messages, the things that he is like so comfortable stating, like it blows my f**king mind that he is so comfortable in abusing and exploiting Amouranth.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p><strong>Read more: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Now you’re just f***ing being a liar” Amouranth Reveals She’s Married and Shows Abusive Chats With Husband</a></strong></p><p>A few while after the phone call, Amouranth revealed that her husband had sent her threatening texts.

She stated that he had threatened to steal the remainder and left her with just $1 million.</p><p>She also stated that it was her husband’s orders that prevented her from previously disclosing her marriage. It was supposedly kept secret because he told her it would destroy their “business model.”</p><p>Many Twitch streamers and other internet personalities have voiced their concerns for Amouranth with respect to her abusive husband.</p><p>Daph, in a tweet, expressed &nbsp;that she is genuinely terrified for Amouranth and hopes she is okay.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>genuinely terrified for amouranth and hope she is ok. she has always been very sweet and its heartbreaking to know the shitstorm behind the scenes. im even more disgusted at the ppl dismissing the abusive relationship cus of her OF.</p>— daph (@39daph) <a href=#>October 16, 2022</a></figure><p>Many other streamers like Valkyrae, Pokimane, and others have reached out to Amouranth about her well being, even going to the extent of sending the police to her house to ensure her safety and security.
