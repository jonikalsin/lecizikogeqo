She was in love with a Pakistani doctor with whom she envisioned marriage — but it never happened.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Princess Diana's life became tabloid fodder following her marriage to Prince Charles. However, she developed an identity as a unique royal: never conforming to royal principles even though she carried out her duties.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Even though there were various controversies about Diana's love life and other personal matters, her principles were based on kindness and advocacy.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>[Left] Pakistani surgeon Hasnat Khan, identified as an "ex-lover" of Lady Diana, Princess of Wales; [Right] Diana, Princess of Wales at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Unfortunately, Diana died after <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a29874597/princess-diana-death/>suffering</a> fatal injuries from an auto crash. She was in the car with her rumored lover, Dodi Fayed, an Egyptian billionaire. The duo had spent the past week enjoying a getaway in Paris and wanted to return to Fayed's private Parisian estate when it happened.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Their driver, Henri Paul, lost control of the vehicle, crashing into a pillar on the road. Instantly, Paul and Fayed died, while Diana, who sustained a cut thigh, broken arm, and suffered from a concussion, was rushed to Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Diana Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Unfortunately, the people's princess never made it out alive. She had internal bleeding and could not regain consciousness. Her time of death was 4.53 a.m., on August 31, 1997.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>The death hurt many people, including fans, friends, and family. Fayed's dad, Mohamed, was bereft, and he accused the British government of murder because Diana was pregnant with his grandchild. Diana's closest pals dismissed the claims.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Instead, they understood that the princess never intended to marry Fayed, nor did she carry his child.

They officially separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Throughout their separation, she lived alone in Kensington Palace and had reordered life her way: enjoying the freedom that came with not being under scrutiny by the royals.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>In 1995, during a visit to the Royal Brompton Hospital to see the husband of her soother in chief, Oonagh Toffolo, she met Khan. The surgeon had come to explain to Toffolo, an acupuncturist, and self-proclaimed healer, that her husband, Joseph, needed to return for surgery.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Diana, Princess Of Wales, Leaving The British Lung Foundation In Hatton Garden After Being Presented With A Bouquet Of The First Rose Named After Her. | Source: Getty images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>When Toffolo introduced the famous princess to her surgeon, he did not seem overly excited. Instead, the man slightly acknowledged with a quick nod and left the room. After admitting that he was handsome, Diana turned to her friend, calling out the surgeon's name as seen on his shoes.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Following the first meeting that blew her away, the people's princess tried to get Khan's attention, but he paid no attention. She consistently visited Joseph throughout his three-week stay and often popped in to chat with the surgeon.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Diana even tried to read Gray's Anatomy so she could have things to discuss with Khan. Eventually, they became friends, and after work hours, the Pakistani native always felt comfortable speaking to the royal because of her humility.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Pakistani surgeon Hasnat Khan, identified as an "ex-lover" of Lady Diana, Princess of Wales. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:center><strong class=Ug>DIANA AND KHAN'S FRIENDSHIP BLOSSOMED QUICKLY</strong></p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Undoubtedly, the duo enjoyed their regular chit-chat, and their friendship soon blossomed into romance.
