He started out with a $10 worth Batman mask and is now listed among the most popular comedian and internet personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, he is known as the Viner. However, after his platform got discontinued, BatDad continued to entertain his fans and followers through Instagram and YouTube.&nbsp;</p><h2>BatDad And His Love Life</h2><p>BatDad <a href=#>was married to Jennifer Smith</a>. The couple exchanged their marital vows in an intimate wedding ceremony in front of their parents, relatives, and close friends. He and his ex-wife were introduced to each other by a mutual friend.&nbsp;</p><p>The ex-pair shares four children together. The former couple welcomed their first child; daughter <strong>Taylor Wilson</strong> on 21 December 2004. Their second child, <strong>Kaya Wilson</strong>, was born on 18 June 2007. His third and fourth children are twins named; son <strong>Benjamin Wilson</strong> and daughter <strong>Sienna Wilson</strong> (born on 26 June 2010).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/2/BatDad%20and%20his%20ex-wife%20Jennifer%20Smith-1614699724167.jpg><p>The family of five was living a happy life. And on a fine day of March 2019, the news of the couple's separation was revealed. It was a great shock for their fans. The news was confirmed by Blake when asked by his fans. Many fans asked about their separation. Some fans even wrote: <i>"You and Jen are done?! Oh, I'm so sorry. Glad you're trying to make friendship happen, though." </i>Another added: "<i>Sorry about you and Jen. She totes cracks me up — you and your wonderful kids do too lol!".</i></p><p>And BatDad replied:<i> "Nada, still friends though! Trying to be co-parenting champions of the world lol." </i>BatDad also shared a video compilation of the funniest memories with his ex-wife, Jennifer Smith.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though BatDad and his ex-spouse are separated, <a href=#>the pair still shares a great friendship</a>. They even co-parent their children for their sake. In an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview with Today, BatDad</a> said: <i>"I know I can be annoying. Also, while speaking about his Have to PBS News Hour in 2014, he claimed: "You know, to be honest, I can't really say I have a great superpower — it really takes two".</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/3/2/Batdad%20and%20his%20family-1614699819594.jpg><p>Further, he added: <i>"I think the superpower if there is one, is being able to read your partner. Reading what they’re feeling. Being able to recognize the signals and knowing when your partner needs a little more help than normal. That’s huge when you’re raising a family.”</i></p><p>The aforementioned interview suggests that the reason for their divorce was the annoying process of making the vines. But, that was funny for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, the actual reason for their divorce is still a mystery.&nbsp;</p><h2>Rise To Popularity And Net Worth</h2><p>As I mentioned above, BatDad aka Blake Wilson&nbsp;started out as a Viner. He started his career with a $10 batman mask and is now worth $250 thousand.&nbsp;</p><p>He gathers his fortune from his career as an American comedian and internet sensation. His primary source of income is from his YouTube channel and Instagram sponsored post.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>According to Influencer Marketing Hub, BatDad makes an estimated earning of $250 to $700 per sponsored post. He has 1.4 million followers with an engagement rate of 11.6%. Another celebrity, <a href=#><strong>Justin Hagan</strong></a> has $700 thousand.</p><p>Similarly, he boosts his net worth from his YouTube earnings, merchandise sales, and sponsorships.&nbsp;</p><p>Do follow <a href=# rel=nofollow>MarriedCeleb</a>, for freshly brewed contents!!!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpuYrZyRmQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./air-force-research-lab-experiment-to-assess-benefits-of-multi-orbit-satellite-navigation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Air Force space experiment will seek to demonstrate multi-orbit satellite navigation">&larr;
