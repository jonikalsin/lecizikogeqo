Marcus was the Tennessee Titans’ second-round pick in the 2015 NFL Draft, and he led the team to three straight winning seasons.</strong></p><p>He played for the Las Vegas Raiders before joining the Atlanta Falcons in 2022. The Falcons’ starting quarterback (QB) is an American footballer. Marcus attended the University of Oregon and was the starting quarterback from 2012 to 2014, becoming the first Hawaiian-born athlete to win the Heisman Trophy.</p><h2><span id=Marcus_Mariotas_Brother_Matthew_Mariota_Age_Difference>Marcus Mariota’s Brother Matthew Mariota; Age Difference</span></h2><p>Matthew a.k.a. “Matt” Marcus Mariota’s younger brother is Mariota. Matt, like his brother, is a football fan. Matt attended Saint Louis School in Honolulu, Hawaii, as well. He majored in Sociology. The two-year letterman garnered an honorable mention as a senior linebacker in the Interscholastic League of Honolulu (ILH).</p><p>Matt helped the Crusaders achieve a 6-4 record in 2014.

He is of German ancestry on his mother’s side, and Samoan ancestry on his father’s. Toa’s father, Toa, started his job in the Department of Homeland Security before moving to Customs and Immigration Enforcement.</p><p>Toa was an enthusiastic rugby player who began playing with Marcus when he was nine years old, which helped him develop his football skills early on. Marcus was an avid sports lover who grew up playing rugby, volleyball, and soccer. As he grew older, he inquired of his parents about playing American football, which was popular in the community.</p><p>His father agreed on the condition that he only play flag football. Everything changed when Marcus enrolled at St. Louis School and became eager to join the football team. His parents eventually agreed after seeing his passion and enthusiasm for the sport. Due to the family’s financial woes, Marcus’ coaching expenses were tough to manage.</p><p>However, because they believed in their child, they sold their home to ensure that he had the best instruction possible. Marcus, on the other hand, blossomed into a standout high school football player by his senior year. On July 1, 2021, the quarterback supposedly married his high school sweetheart Kiyomi Cook in a low-key wedding ceremony on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.
