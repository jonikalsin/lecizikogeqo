It was lovely, charming, and most of it all, fans fell in love with the characters. To be more precise, fans fell in love with the on-screen relationship between Joe Locke and Kit Connor.</p><p>So, it got many of us thinking are they an item in real life? Is there something between Joe and Kit beyond the TV show? Let’s dig deep into this question.</p><h3><strong>Are “Heartstopper” Stars Joe Locke And Kit Connor Dating IRL?</strong></h3><p>Netflix’s new show Heartstopper is a teen drama about school students. The two leads on the show are Joe Locke appearing on the show as Charlie Spring and Kit Connor portrayed the role of Nick Nelson. The show is an adaptation of the writer Alice Oseman from her graphic novel series of the same name.</p><p>It follows 14-year-old Charlie as he develops feelings for popular rugby player Nick after the two bonds over whether or not doing homework on the way to maths is suitable. It’s unmistakably pleasant and wholesome, and by the end of its brisk eight episodes, you’ll feel like you’ve been given a hearty hug.</p><p>Charlie is already out of school and has been bullied as a result, but he appears to have found a supportive friendship group that values their movie nights and sends a lot of DMs to each other. (There’s a lot of on-screen messaging in this, and it’s tensely effective to see folks type, delete, redo, and re-delete their responses.)</p><p>Ben, Charlie’s secret sort of boyfriend, meets up with him in the library during recess but picks on him when no one else is present. Nick comes to his rescue when Ben advances from treating him coldly to acquiring a girlfriend and then disparaging him when they’re together, and their friendship slowly evolves into something more.</p><p>It’s very nice. With periods of animation, it pays homage to its origins as a visual novel, especially when emotions are running high. Hands are almost touching; between them, cartoon lightning crackles. Hearts emerge in the air as Charlie’s buddy Elle wonders if she has a love for their other friend, Tao.</p><p>It appears to be a remake of Hollyoaks with an art school twist. There are a few minor squabbles among Charlie’s friends, but the focus is primarily on Charlie and Nick. With the exception of a parent and Stephen Fry, who appears as the headteacher shouting over the Tannoy, the adults are virtually non-existent.</p><p>While speaking interviewing with Attitude, Joe and Kit also recalled their on-screen kiss during rehearsal.</p><p>“I drank a lot of coffee, but I feel like that’s just part of me!” admitted Joe in the interview. “I would arrive [on set] and have a coffee straight away because I wouldn’t be able to function.” Kit utters with a smirk: “It did mean there were a couple of kissing scenes where I was punished deeply…”</p><p>“This makes me sound like a really bad person!” exclaims Joe. “I had a chewy, I had chewing gum!” Kit continues: “Yeah, there was one point where you were caught off guard and you were like, ‘Ok, we need to rehearse this kissing scene….”</p><p>The chemistry between the two is undeniable. So, it got the fans thinking if they are dating in real life. Are Joe Locke and Kit Connor dating in IRL? Keep reading to learn more.</p><h3><strong>Are “Heartstopper” Stars Joe Locke And Kit Connor Friends?</strong></h3><p>No, Heartstopper stars Joe Locke and Kit Connor aren’t in any romantic relationships. Their relationship is safe to label as “friends” and “co-stars” and nothing more. Fans who loved the show so much started following the stars and watching closely the details realtionship.</p><p>According to the followers, Joe might be dating fellow star, Sebastian Croft. The rumor of their romance began when fans realized that Joe and Sebastian were the cast members who shared a lot of <a href=#>images</a> together with each other. Fans were confused about their relationship status after seeing two photos in particular.</p><p>Joe Locke’s Instagram feed has one of those photographs. Joe and Sebastian are wearing matching jackets in the photo, but there’s nothing in the picture that suggests they’re dating. Sebastian Croft’s Instagram page has the other image. Joe and Sebastian are pictured hugging and smiling at the camera. Nothing in the photo indicates that they are a couple. In fact, both Joe Locke and Sebastian Croft appear to be single.</p><p>But, fans loved their relationship on the show. As an appreciation, they also read the fans’ comments about the show.</p><p>They have also featured on each other’s socials, but only as friends.</p><h3><strong>Have Joe Locke And Kit Connor Starred In A Project Other Than Heartstopper?</strong></h3><p>For Joe Locke and Kit Connor, this is the first project they have worked on together, as per their respective IMDB profile. But, since fans loved how they complimented each other on-screen, this could be one of many shows they may star together if the producers choose to listen to the fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmo6eVYrmwr8qeZJqmlGK4qsCMnKanpp%2BneqWt06KloGWWp7amusOsZKiqXai2rrzLsmScp12owaK%2B0mg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jake-layman.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Layman">&larr;
