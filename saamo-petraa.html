Source: Instagram</p><h4>Some interesting facts</h4><p>Petra doesn’t listen to folk music and prefers rap, pop, and rock. She is a movie fan and tends to dedicate her free time to that activity. She’s an introvert who prefers her time alone instead of being in the company of others and has no social anxiety. She got her 1st tattoo of a moon on her right shoulder blade in early December 2016. Because she was younger than 18, she acknowledged that it was risky and illegal, but loved the experience.</p><p>Petra tried singing as a kid, but later realized she had no talent for music, neither for singing nor playing an instrument. Her least favorite school subject was mathematics. Furthermore, she had her 1st kiss in the 8th grade, at the age of 13 or 14. She drank alcohol for the 1st time during the New Year’s Eve celebration for the year 2014. Petra met one of her favorite YouTubers, Anthony Padilla from Smosh, at the VidCon Europe 2017 event in Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p><h4>Veganism and Gym</h4><p>Even chicken meat was her favorite food in 2015, and due to her love of animals and nature, she transitioned to a vegetarian lifestyle. Later, Petra admitted that her conscience had been much clearer and that the switch helped her a lot. She replied that she would have switched to veganism, but certain health issues stopped her.</p><p>Petra also reported that her weight went from 64 kg to 58 kg in a short period after switching to vegetarianism, and then varied between 58 kg and 60 kg. After playing tennis and dancing for most of her life, in early 2018 she began going to the gym due to the lack of time. However, despite feeling more confident and happier, she still saw the gym workouts as a means to an end and didn’t feel too excited about it.</p><h2><span id=Brand_Endorsements>Brand Endorsements</span></h2><p>The social media star is also famous for her brand endorsement activities.

They shared numerous social media posts and were in a YouTube-based creator group named Team Lens. They also recorded challenge videos such as ‘Never Have I Ever’, ‘Who Knows Me Better – Boyfriend vs. Best Friend’, and ‘Q&A’, and uploaded vlogs of exotic destinations worldwide they visited together.</p><p>Sadly, they broke up in October 2018, but away from the public eye. When it was asked about it, @vanimy claimed it was a private matter, but asked the joint fan pages to be removed or edited to accommodate their break up. She also agreed with his request for YouTube drama, as she vowed never to be mixed up with drama for views. @Vanimy and Petraa also added that their friends who were also YouTubers shouldn’t be tagged or asked about the topic, because they won’t reveal the real reason either.</p><p>Currently, she seems to be in a relationship with Marco Cᴜᴄᴄᴜrin. The duo often shares their beautiful pictures on their social media handles.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-22315 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Saamo-Petraa-ex.jpg alt="Saamo Petraa- ex" width=650 height=520 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-22315 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Saamo Petraa and Alen Žabo’s kissing photograph.
