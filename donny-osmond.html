In short order, the group was invited to audition for The Andy Williams Show. Williams initially had reservations about featuring children on the program, however, encouraged by his father to try them out, they proved in a short period of time to become an asset to the program, and soon became regulars on the show and gained popularity quickly. In 1963, Donny Osmond made his debut on the show at the age of five singing “You Are My Sunshine”. The brothers continued to perform on the show throughout the 1960s along with a visit from their sister Marie. Osmond became a teen idol in the early 1970s as a solo singer, while continuing to sing with his older brothers.

He was described in the 1980s as having an “unhip image”, and he said he was embarrassed that the Osmond name was not considered cool.
