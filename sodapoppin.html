His passion for video games increased with every passing day. Later when he joined junior college, he decided to make a career in the field of gaming.</p><p>Chance Morris began streaming on Twitch in 2012 after switching from Xfire. Likewise, he was a successful World of Warcraft player reaching the top rank with over half of Twitch’s WoW followers viewing him. He streamed other games before switching to online gambling. Further, he was streaming blackjack gambling on casino websites, winning and losing thousands of dollars on any given day.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-18646 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sodapoppin-Twitching.jpg alt="Sodapoppin Twitching" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-18646 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Sodapoppin while he was live on Twitch (Source: Instagram)</p><p>He co-owned the Canadian streamer eSports organization Northern Gaming. The organization was purchased by NRG Esports which is owned by Shaquille O’Neal, Alex Rodriguez, and others as well. In October 2017, he eliminated fellow streamer Dr. DisRespect from the H1Z1 Invitational tournament. Sadly, he couldn’t make it to the top ten. According to SocialBlade, He sits at the number 20 spot for the most followers on Twitch as of February 2020. He is also in the rank of number 12 for the total number of views on Twitch. He also remains active on Reddit.</p><p>Despite being a popular streamer, he was suspended on several occasions from Twitch as he was caught harassing a Twitch staff and also logging into a second Twitch account to watch other streamers and was also banned for “foot porn” and promotion of illegal activity.</p><h4>YouTube and More</h4><p>Some of his friends suggested he try out YouTube and listen to them, so he created a YouTube channel named ‘<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sodapoppin</a>‘ to make it sound appealing and exciting. He uploaded his first video in 2012 in which he was playing a popular game called ‘Amnesia 2’.</p><p>He initially posted some random videos without giving much thought to the content. He created the channel just to have fun but to his surprise, his channel became popular within a year and managed to acquire a considerable number of followers.</p><p>Furthermore, when he moved to Michigan his social media career received a major boost. After starting by posting videos on ‘World of Warcraft’, he began to expand his horizons and started playing games of different genres.</p><p>Morris has collaborated with fellow YouTuber Sky Williams who has appeared on his channel on several occasions. He also designs his line of graphic T-shirts for kids and teens and sells them under the brand, ‘Teespring’.</p><h2><span id=Awards>Awards</span></h2><p>Chance Morris has won the ‘Best Streamer of the Year’ award which was presented to him by the team of ‘World of Warcraft. Moreover, he earned other awards as well. He got Blizzard Stream Awards for his different and amazing style of videos.

Also, many sites claim that he also does some brand endorsement activities. However, the details regarding it are not clear. We hope that we will be seeing him as the brand ambassador for major brands soon.</p><h2><span id=Dating_Marriage_and_Rumors>Dating, Marriage, and Rumors</span></h2><p>As stated in some sites like Wealthypersons and Taddlr, he is in a relationship with fellow Twitch gaming star, Lea May Currier. Unfortunately, both persons have not posted pictures with each other on their Instagram accounts. We may assume that they have broken up now and Chance is possibly single at the moment, or they like to keep their relationship private. On the other hand, there are rumors that he is dating fellow YouTuber Veibae. However, there are no valid details about it.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-18647 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sodapoppin-and-girlfriend.jpg alt="Sodapoppin and girlfriend" width=650 height=363 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-18647 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Sodapoppin with his ex-girlfriend, Lea May Currier (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Sodapoppin_8211_Body_Measurements>Sodapoppin – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>His <strong>height</strong> is 5 feet 7 inches and his weight is 78 Kg.
